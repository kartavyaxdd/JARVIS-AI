I'll write a simple Python program for you. Here's a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen:

```
# This is a comment - anything after the "#" symbol is ignored by the compiler

print("Hello, World!")  # This line prints the string to the screen
```

If you want something more complex, please let me know!

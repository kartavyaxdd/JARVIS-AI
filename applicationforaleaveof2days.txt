Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence for two consecutive days, i.e., [Date] and [Date]. I have a personal commitment that I must attend to on these days and it cannot be rescheduled.

I will ensure that all my tasks are completed and my work is up to date before taking the leave. I will also be available on call/email if anything urgent comes up during my absence.

I would like to request your approval for these two days. I will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as possible upon my return.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
